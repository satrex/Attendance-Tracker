Semesters :

All of us are from 4th Semester PESIT-CS



ABOUT YOUR PROJECT :

The project involves having a place where the student can get all the statistics regarding the classes 
he/she missed, whether it’s falling in the shortage zone etc. Updates for him/her once a fortnight or so. 
Using technologies like textweb, we can also write scripts that alert a student once the percentage of 
attendances falls under the requirements so that he/she can be more careful in the future



GOAL :

Complete the web-app and the mobile-app within the specified time 
We will try to stick to the road map as much as possible 
We will try to further improvise and also add extra features as we go on coding



USE CASES :

Provision for verification of attendence before internals and externals as well by the students online 
This basically prevents paper work by each department for verification. 
Since the attendence is taken and updated to the database as soon as the teacher cofirms 
there is no need to update in the register as we will ensure that our web-app will be 
secure and reliable



EXPECTED RESULTS :

A web app and mobile app/s that allow a student to track his attendance statistics at any time, 
with additional features like attendance shortage alert.



IDEAS AND IMPLEMENTATION :

Basic Idea in a few words

The Teacher has a mobile and he/she connects to the webiste which we are going to develop
The website wil have a user friendly GUI and the teacher will update the attendence there
After the teacher confirms about the attendence, it will automatically updated in the database maintained by us
A restriction will be made so that only the teacher for that subject will be able to update attendence for that subject
All the updates will be reflected in the website then and there and students can view it anytime
As soon as the attendence percentage of a student falls in the shortage zone, a message will be sent to him/her regarding this
Also a restricted access like a student can see only his attendence statistics can be implemented is necessary
An extra provision can be made to alert the student before in hand that if he/she misses the next class, then he/she is
going to end up in shortage zone for that particular subject (a boon for students)
At the end, marks for attendence will be automatically calculated and displayed, with the following cut offs
Attended more than 95% of the classes : 5 marks
90%-95% : 4marks
85%-90% : 3marks
80%-85% : 2marks
75%-80% : 1mark
Below 75% : Shortage of Attendence, not allowed to write exams
Messages will be sent automatically to Students and parents as : 
1. Fortnightly updates 
2. Warnings to those students who are in the shortage zone 
3. Alerts to those students who might face shortage of attendence soon 
This can be achieved by using txtweb like facilities
An option to import input information from the Database as an Excel Document can also be implemented
An additional option which displays number of classes the student has to attend to get required percentage can be added 
so that students with genuine reasons for absence(illness and other major problems) can check it out
Provision for verification of attendence before internals and externals as well by the students online
Also Sessional attendence display can be linked to online notice board(if any), of respective department
The teacher has the control over the maximum number of classes conducted for that subject, i.e, if the 
portions are not completed, then he/she might take few extra classes
The zones can be represented in terms of colors, as in 
red color : shortage of attendence zone
orange color : going to fall in the shortage zone
green color : to indicate that the student has no attendence issues
The main layout looks like

Maximum number of classes 
( which can be modified later by the teachers )	Number of classes conducted	Number of classes attended	Number of classes missed	Zone 
( red|orange|green )	Attendence percentage



ROAD MAP :

Learn basics of CSS, JS and brush up with HTML5 and Python by 23rd june
Start Coding and finish the basic layout of the app as required by the client ( college here ) by 30
Integrating txtweb into the project and continue coding till 7 july
Complete coding web app on july 14 ( Pre-Final )
For the next week, one of us will be working on Debuging the code of web app and other two will be brushing 
up a bit with Qt and j2me or some other platform i.e, till 21st july
Start Coding for the mobile app and be done with the initial phase by 28th july
Complete mobile app based on 1 platform on or before august 4th ( Pre_final )
Complete mobile app based on 2nd platform on or before august 11th ( Pre_final )
Debug codes of mobile apps, improve wherever possible and Finalize the project by 14th
Submit the Project on 16 ( hopefully! ).


ABOUT YOUR TEAM :

Our team is basically a combination of skill and hardwork 
All three of us are very keen on contributing to OpenSource ( or Free Software! ) 
And also continue contributing to other global OpenSource projects even after the Summer Vacations.



WHY YOU? :

Enthusiasm is our strength. Eagerness to work and to contribute to OpenSource is our driving force. 
We really wanted to contribute to OpenSource, but we didn't know how to get started 
This PSoC will be like a stepping stone for us into the world of OpenSource. 
We already started learning required skills like html and so we have the cofidence that we can do this project successfully
