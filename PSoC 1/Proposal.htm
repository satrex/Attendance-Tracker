  <h1>Proposal for Attendence Tracker</h1>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>Semesters :</h3>
  <p>All of us are from 4th Semester PESIT-CS</p>
  <br>
  <br>
	 
  <h3>ABOUT YOUR PROJECT :</h3>
  <p>The project involves having a place where the student can get all the statistics regarding the classes
  <br>he/she missed, whether it’s falling in the shortage zone etc. Updates for him/her once a fortnight or so. 
  <br>Using technologies like textweb, we can also write scripts that alert a student once the percentage of 
  <br>attendances falls under the requirements so that he/she can be more careful in the future</p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>GOAL :</h3>
  <p>Complete the web-app and the mobile-app within the specified time
  <br>We will try to stick to the road map as much as possible
  <br>We will try to further improvise and also add extra features as we go on coding</p>
  <br>
  <br>



  <h3>USE CASES :</h3>
  <p>Provision for verification of attendence before internals and externals as well by the students online
  <br>This basically prevents <strong>paper work</strong> by each department for verification.
  <br>Since the attendence is taken and updated to the database as soon as the teacher cofirms
  <br>there is no need to update in the register as we will ensure that our web-app will be
  <br><strong>secure</strong> and <strong>reliable</strong>
  <br>Special option for checking required number of classes to get as much percentage of attendence required
  <br>(so that the student missing class for genuine reasons can make use of it), which is not present in current system</p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>EXPECTED RESULTS :</h3>
  <p>A web app and mobile app/s that allow a student to track his attendance statistics at any time, 
  <br>with additional features like attendance shortage alert.</p>
  <br>
  <br>    
   
  <h3>IDEAS AND IMPLEMENTATION :</h3>
  
  <h3>Basic Idea in a few words</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>The Teacher has a mobile and he/she connects to the webiste which we are going to develop</li>
  <li>The website wil have a user friendly GUI and the teacher will update the attendence there</li>
  <li>After the teacher confirms about the attendence, it will automatically updated in the database maintained by us</li>
  <li>A restriction will be made so that only the teacher for that subject will be able to update attendence for that subject</li>
  <li>All the updates will be reflected in the website then and there and students can view it anytime</li>
  <li>As soon as the attendence percentage of a student falls in the shortage zone, a message will be sent to him/her regarding this</li>
  <li>Also a restricted access like a student can see only his attendence statistics can be implemented is necessary</li>
  <li><strong>An extra provision can be made to alert the student before in hand that if he/she misses the next class, then he/she is<br> going to end up in shortage zone for that particular subject</strong> (<em>a boon for students</em>)</li>
  <li>At the end, marks for attendence will be automatically calculated and displayed, with the following cut offs</li>
  <ol>
  <li>Attended more than 95% of the classes : 5 marks</li>
  <li>90%-95% : 4marks</li>
  <li>85%-90% : 3marks</li>
  <li>80%-85% : 2marks</li>
  <li>75%-80% : 1mark</li>
  <li>Below 75% : Shortage of Attendence, not allowed to write exams</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Messages will be sent automatically to <strong>Students</strong> and <strong>parents</strong> as : 
  <br> 1. Fortnightly updates 
  <br> 2. <strong>Warnings</strong> to those students who are in the shortage zone
  <br> 3. <strong>Alerts</strong> to those students who might face shortage of attendence soon
  <br>This can be achieved by using <em>txtweb</em> like facilities</li>
  <li>An option to import input information from the Database as an Excel Document can also be implemented</li>
  <li><strong>An additional option which displays number of classes the student has to attend to get required percentage can be added
  <br />so that students with genuine reasons for absence(illness and other major problems) can check it out</strong></li>
  <li>Provision for verification of attendence before internals and externals as well by the students online
  </li><li>Also Sessional attendence display can be linked to online notice board(if any), of respective department</li>
  <li>The teacher has the control over the maximum number of classes conducted for that subject, i.e, if the 
  <br>portions are not completed, then he/she might take few extra classes</li>
  <li>The zones can be represented in terms of colors, as in
  <br> <ol>
  	  	 <li>red color : shortage of attendence zone</li>
		 <li>orange color : going to fall in the shortage zone</li>
		 <li>green color : to indicate that the student has no attendence issues</li>
		 </ol></li>
  
  <p>The main layout looks like</p>
  
  <table border="3">
  <tbody><tr><th>Maximum number of classes <br> ( which can be modified later by the teachers )
  </th><th>Number of classes conducted</th>
  <th>Number of classes attended</th>
  <th>Number of classes missed</th>
  <th>Zone <br> ( red|orange|green )</th>
  <th>Attendence percentage</th>
  </tr></tbody></table>
  </ul>
  <br>  
  <br>
  <br>



  <h3>ROAD MAP :</h3>
  <ul> 
  <li>Learn basics of CSS, JS and brush up with HTML5 and Python by 23rd june</li>
  <li>Start Coding and finish the basic layout of the app as required by the client ( college here ) by 30</li>
  <li>Integrating txtweb into the project and continue coding till 7 july</li>
  <li>Complete coding web app on july 14 ( Pre-Final )</li>
  <li>For the next week, one of us will be working on Debuging the code of web app and other two will be brushing 
<br>up a bit with Qt and j2me or some other platform i.e, till 21st july</li>
  <li>Start Coding for the mobile app and be done with the initial phase by 28th july</li>    
  <li>Complete mobile app based on 1 platform on or before august 4th ( Pre_final )</li>
  <li>Complete mobile app based on 2nd platform on or before august 11th ( Pre_final )</li>
  <li>Debug codes of mobile apps, improve wherever possible and Finalize the project by 14th</li>
  <li>Submit the Project on 16 ( hopefully! ).</li>
  </ul> 
  <br> 
  <br>        

  <h3>ABOUT YOUR TEAM :</h3>
  <p>Our team is basically a combination of skill and hardwork
  <br>All three of us are very keen on contributing to OpenSource ( or Free Software! )
  <br>And also continue contributing to other global OpenSource projects even after the Summer Vacations.</p>	  
  <br>
  <br>	
  
  <h3>WHY YOU? :</h3>   
  <p><strong>Enthusiasm</strong> is our strength. <strong>Eagerness</strong> to work and to contribute to OpenSource is our driving force.
  <br>We really wanted to contribute to OpenSource, but we didn't know how to get started
  <br>This PSoC will be like a stepping stone for us into the world of OpenSource.
  <br>We already started learning required skills like html and so we have the cofidence that we can do this project successfully</p>
  <br>
